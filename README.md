# IGIMF_Theory_codes
This repository contains codes to generate data samples of stars for star clusters or even whole galaxies. It is based on the IGIMF Theory and similar to the galIMF code by Yan Zhiquiang et al. In contrast to their codes, this module calculates the discrete stellar masses. This allows more easily to simulate composite IMFs of star-forming regions.
